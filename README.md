# NIST SP 800-171 OSCAL Content

## Background

OSCAL is the state of the art for compliance automation.

All OSCAL models must derive content from an OSCAL Catalog and OSCAL Profile.

NIST provides this source material for SP 800-53 (AKA RMF). However, they have not yet published the same content for SP 800-171 (Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations).

All DoD contractors processing, storing, or transmitting CUI must follow SP 800-171.

Therefore, if DoD contractors want to leverage the state of the art to automate CUI Protection compliance, this project provides the fundamental building blocks.
